# graphql-example
Simple example of creating a graphql schema on top of a simple REST service

**This repository has 2 branches**
1. main --> A simple Flask Rest service with basic operations on data defined in data.py
2. graphql --> The same Flask service in main, but with added GraphQL schema and resolvers

Hope it's useful!
